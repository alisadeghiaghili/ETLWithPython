# Introduction

Extract, Transform and Load (ETL) operations are of extreme importance in the role of a Data engineer. A data engineer 
extracts data from multiple sources and different file formats, transforms the extracted data to predefined settings 
and then loads the data to a database for further processing. In this lab, you will get hands-on practice of performing 
these operations.

This Code:

    - Reads CSV, JSON, and XML file types.
    - Extracts the required data from the different file types.
    - Transforms data to the required format.
    - Saves the transformed data in a ready-to-load format, which can be loaded into an RDBMS.
